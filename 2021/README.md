### Running Solutions

I use Emacs and [Sly](https://github.com/joaotavora/sly) for my Common Lisp dev environment.

Used a couple systems for some of the problems.

- [hashset](https://quickref.common-lisp.net/hash-set.html)
- [cl-utilities](https://common-lisp.net/project/cl-utilities/)

I load them into the REPL using [quicklisp](https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/)
