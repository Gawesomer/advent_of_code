# advent_of_code

My solutions to Erick Wastl's 
[Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenges.

### Running Solutions

Solution for a given day must be run from within the year's directory.<br>
(i.e. `cwd == advent_of_code/{year}`):<br>
`advent_of_code/2020$ python3 -m day_01.code`

### Running Tests

Tests should be run from within the year's directory.<br>
(i.e. `cwd == advent_of_code/{year}`)

Full test suite can be run with:<br>
`advent_of_code/2020$ python3 -m unittest discover`

Tests for single challenge can be run with:<br>
`advent_of_code/2020$ python3 -m unittest day_01/test.py`

### Note to the reader

Most of this is poorly tested, bad code written by a tired guy late at night.<br>
You've been warned.
